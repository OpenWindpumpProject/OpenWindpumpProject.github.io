For now this is just a dummy page, but if you are a web designer, homepage admin, digital artist or gifted writer please let us know. We are always looking for people who like to add content and beauty to this page. More informations about the Project "http://www.greendesert.eu/wasserpumpenworkshop">here< (sadly just in German)

The Project in a Nutshell


Everybody knows windpumps. They have been invented more than a hundred years ago and still frame our picture of an australian outback or an old school western. Any patent would have
ran out more than a century ago. Hence, what we do is fairly simple. We gonna OpenSource this technology by providing a detailled struction, lists of material as well as needed tools
and publish even our CAD drawings for everybody - worldwide and fully OpenSource. Feel free to join us anytime.
